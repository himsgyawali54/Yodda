                  being ranked among the top 10 countries in the world according
                  to the United Nations Human Development Index, offers a

                  aspiring applicants need to attain a minimum of 65 points,
                  considering various factors such as education, work

                  and qualifications that will have a positive impact on
                  Australia's labour shortages. These streams help to determine

                              government to apply for the subclass 189 visa.
                              This invitation is typically based on factors such
                              as your occupation, skills, and points score. It
                              is important to meet the eligibility requirements
                              and express your interest in migrating to
                              Australia through the appropriate channels. Upon
                              receiving the invitation, you can proceed with the
                              visa application process.

                              undergo a skills assessment. This assessment is
                              conducted by a designated assessing authority
                              recognized by the Australian government. It is
                              important to provide accurate and complete
                              documentation during the assessment process.

                              to apply. Age is an important factor in the
                              points-based system used to assess visa
                              eligibility. Points are allocated based on
                              different age brackets, with higher points awarded
                              to younger applicants. Meeting the age requirement
                              can significantly increase your chances of
                              qualifying for the visa.

                              points to be eligible. Points are awarded based on
                              various factors such as age, English language
                              proficiency, work experience, education, and other
                              relevant qualifications. The higher your points

                              invitation to apply for the visa.

                              financial obligations. Having outstanding debts
                              can affect your eligibility for the visa. It is

                  How to Apply For a Skilled Independent VISA Subclass 189?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  To apply for a Skilled Independent Visa (subclass 189), gather
                  the required documents such as a passport, educational
                  certificates, and English language test scores. Submit an
                  Expression of Interest (EOI) on SkillSelect, aiming for a
                  minimum score of 65 points. If eligible, you may receive an
                  invitation from the Department of Home Affairs to apply for
                  the visa. Lodge your application within 60 days, including all
                  documents and fees. Undergo health and character assessments
                  by completing medical examinations and providing police
                  clearance certificates. Wait for a decision as the Department
                  assesses your application. If approved, you'll receive a
                  Skilled Independent Visa (subclass 189) grant letter.

                  Estimated Costs for 189 Visa
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The current cost of a subclass 189 visa is AUD$ 4,045 for the
                  main applicant. Keep in mind that there are additional fees
                  for each family member included in the application. If any
                  family member over 18 years old has limited English skills,
                  there will be an extra charge of AUD$ 4,885, but this is only
                  applicable if the visa is approved. Remember to consider other
                  expenses such as health checks, police certificates, and
                  biometrics as well. It's important to budget for these costs
                  when applying for a visa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When it comes to the New Zealand stream of the Skilled
                  Independent visa (subclass 189), the cost is the same as the
                  main subclass 189 stream. For the primary applicant, it will
                  be AUD$4,045. If you have family members over 18 years old,
                  they will need to pay AUD$2,020, and for those under 18 years
                  old, the cost will be AUD$1,015. Keep in mind that there might
                  be additional fees depending on your specific situation. To
                  get a better idea of the costs, you can use the Visa Pricing
                  Estimator available on the Home Affairs website. It will help
                  you calculate the expenses more accurately.

                  Processing Time of Skilled Independent 189 Visas
                </h2>
                <p>
                  On average the processing time of a skilled independent 189
                  visa takes around 8 months to 1 year. The following points are
                  the detailed information on the timeline of visa application:
                </p>
                <h3>1. Confirming Profile Existence:</h3>
                <p>
                  It typically takes 7 to 12 working days to confirm if your
                  profile exists in the Skilled Occupation List (SOL), which
                  outlines eligible occupations for the subclass 189 visa.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Meeting Eligibility Requirements:</h3>
                <p>
                  You should ensure that you meet all the eligibility
                  requirements, which may take up to 15 days to assess and
                  gather the necessary documents.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Skills Assessment Tests:</h3>
                <p>
                  The skills assessment tests, which evaluate your
                  qualifications and work experience, usually take around 2 to 3
                  months to complete.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Expression of Interest (EOI) Submission:</h3>
                <p>
                  Once you have successfully completed the skills assessment,
                  you will need to submit an
                  <a href="skillselect-eoi"
                    >Expression Of Interest through SkillSelect</a
                  >. This step typically takes 15 working days.
                </p>
                <h3>5. Visa Application Lodgement:</h3>
                <p>
                  After receiving an invitation to apply, you will need to lodge
                  your visa application, which generally takes about 2 months to
                  complete.
                </p>
                <h3>6. Decision Waiting Period:</h3>
                <p>
                  Once your visa application has been submitted, you will need
                  to wait for a decision, which can take approximately 15 to 30
                  days.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The visa allows you to live and work freely in Australia
                  without any restrictions or the need for employer sponsorship,
                  providing independence and flexibility. Although, the whole
                  189 visa process might seem lengthy and exhausting but in the
                  end, it's all worth it. The endless opportunities and
                  entitlements that you get from the visa are impressive
                  compared to other visas.

                        189 Visa can be refused if you have not fulfilled the
                        eligibility criteria or if the information you have

                        On average, subclass 189 visa processing time can vary
                        from 8 months to one year for the visa grant. As the
                        visa grant requirements have various criteria to be
                        fulfilled as well as you need to receive an invitation
                        to apply for the visa the visa grant process takes a
                        lengthy duration.
