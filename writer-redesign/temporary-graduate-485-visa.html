                  excellent opportunity to extend your stay and kickstart your
                  career in this vibrant country. 485 Visa Australia allows you
                  to work, study, and live in Australia temporarily, providing a
                  valuable transition from student life to the professional
                  world. The duration of this visa may range from 18 months to 5
                  years depending on the visa stream you choose. However, each
                  of the streams has got their own requirements, costs, and
                  benefits.

                <p>
                  A 485 visa requires an online application submission. You must
                  have an ImmiAccount in order to submit a successful
                  application. If you don’t have the account then you can create
                  a new ImmiAccount from the Australian Department of Home
                  Affairs site. You will find the instructions for how to apply,
                  and a complete list of the essential documents you must submit
                  for your visa application on the site. However, you have to
                  carefully select the visa stream while applying as you cannot
                  change the visa streams once you have applied.
                </p>
                <h3>Attach and Submit the Necessary Documents</h3>
                <p>

                  application after you’ve chosen the 485 visa stream you are
                  applying for. You will need to submit scanned copies of your
                  original documents or scanned photocopies if you are applying
                  online. You need to make sure to prepare your documents in a
                  way that allows them to be easily uploaded as files.
                </p>
                <h3>Paying the Application Fee</h3>
                <p>
                  You must pay the application fee to get your application
                  processed. If not, your application won’t get processed. You
                  must pay the fee online from the payment options in the
                  ImmiAccount.
                </p>
                <h3>Submit Your Application</h3>
                <p>
                  You can proceed to submit your application once you’ve made
                  the payment for the application. You need to submit your
                  application on time, taking into consideration the Australian
                  Eastern Standard Time (AEST).
                </p>
                <h3>Wait for the Visa Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                  After all the above process is completed, all you need to do
                  is to wait for the result from the Australian Department of
                  Home Affairs.

                <p>
                  The temporary graduate visa 485 provides an opportunity for
                  you to transition to permanent residency. Although the 485
                  visa is a temporary visa, it can serve as a pathway towards
                  permanent residency through various immigration programs.
                  However, you would need to plan ahead to obtain a PR. The
                  following are the ways through which you can get

                </p>
                <h3>Skilled Migration Pathways</h3>
                <p>
                  The work experience gained during the Subclass 485 Temporary
                  Graduate Visa can help you to increase the points for the
                  points-based visas, such as the Skilled Work Regional
                  (provisional) visa subclass 491 and State Sponsored 190 visa.
                </p>
                <h3>Employer-Sponsored Visa</h3>
                <p>
                  The Employer Sponsored 186 visa is a permanent visa that
                  requires an employer willing to sponsor you. At least three
                  years of work experience relevant to the particular occupation
                  will be required, which you can gain with a 485 visa.
                </p>
                <h3>State or Territory Nomination</h3>
                <p>
                  Some permanent residency programs, such as the subclass 190
                  visa, require nomination by an Australian state or territory
                  government. Having Australian work experience through the
                  subclass 485 visa can increase the chances of receiving a
                  nomination.
                </p>
                <h3>Points-Based System</h3>
                <p>
                  Australia's permanent residency programs use a points-based
                  system to evaluate you on the basis of factors such as age,
                  education, work experience, English language proficiency,etc.
                  Thus, work experience gained during the subclass 485 visa
                  period can contribute to the overall points score and improve
                  the chances of obtaining permanent residency. Also, if you are
                  an accountant, engineer, or IT professional, you can do a
                  professional year, which will add 5 points to your points test
                  and can also help with your skills assessment.
