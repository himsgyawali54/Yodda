                  The IPENZ (Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand)
                  Skilled Migration Assessment is a process that evaluates the
                  qualifications and experience of engineers who wish to migrate
                  to New Zealand under the Skilled Migrant Category of the
                  country's immigration policy. The assessment is conducted by
                  IPENZ, which is a professional body for engineers in New
                  Zealand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Skilled Migration Assessment is designed to ensure that
                  the skills and experience of the engineers meet the standards
                  expected in New Zealand. It involves a thorough evaluation of
                  the engineer's academic qualifications, work experience, and
                  other relevant factors such as their English language
                  proficiency. To move to New Zealand, individuals are required
                  to provide a
                  <a href="ka02-report-writing"
                    >KA02 report for skills assessment</a
                  >. This report is evaluated by the IPENZ to determine the
                  proficiency level of candidates who lack proper engineering
                  qualifications. If an engineer's qualifications and experience
                  meet the requirements, IPENZ will issue a letter to the
                  engineer confirming that they have met the standard required
                  for Skilled Migrant Category residence in New Zealand. This
                  letter can be submitted to the New Zealand immigration
                  authorities as part of the visa application process.

                  What is the IPENZ Competence Assessment?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The IPENZ Competence Assessment is a process that evaluates
                  the competence of overseas-trained engineers who wish to
                  become registered as
                  <a href="chartered-professional-engineers" target="_blank"
                    >Chartered Professional Engineers (CPEng)</a
                  >
                  in New Zealand. The assessment is conducted by IPENZ, which is
                  a professional body for engineers in New Zealand. The purpose
                  of the IPENZ Competence Assessment is to ensure that
                  overseas-trained engineers meet the same standards of
                  competence as those trained in New Zealand. The assessment
                  involves a review of the engineer's academic qualifications,
                  work experience, and other relevant factors such as their
                  ability to communicate in English.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If an engineer's qualifications and experience meet the
                  requirements, IPENZ will recommend the engineer for
                  registration as a CPEng in New Zealand. This registration is a
                  formal recognition of an engineer's competence and
                  professional standing, and can be an important factor in
                  securing employment in the New Zealand engineering sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is important to note that the IPENZ Competence Assessment
                  and the IPENZ New Zealand Skilled Migration Assessment are two
                  different processes with different purposes.

                  Overseas-trained engineers who wish to become registered as
                  Chartered Professional Engineers (CPEng) in New Zealand need
                  to go through the IPENZ Competence Assessment. The assessment
                  is required to ensure that overseas-trained engineers meet the
                  same standards of competence as those trained in New Zealand
                  and are competent to practice engineering in New Zealand. The

                  professional standing, and is highly valued in the New Zealand
                  engineering sector. It demonstrates that an engineer has met
                  the high standards set by IPENZ and is recognized as a
                  competent and qualified engineering professional in New
                  Zealand.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  The assessment process varies depending on the applicant.
                  However, the most common assessment process and criteria has
                  the following steps:
                </p>
                <h3>Eligibility check</h3>
                <p>
                  The first step in the assessment process is to check whether
                  an engineer is eligible for the Skilled Migrant Category visa.
                  This involves checking the engineer's age, health, character,
                  and English language proficiency.
                </p>
                <h3>Initial assessment</h3>
                <p>
                  Once the eligibility check is complete, the engineer can
                  submit an application to IPENZ for an initial assessment. This
                  involves providing details of their academic qualifications
                  and work experience.
                </p>
                <h3>Outcome of initial assessment</h3>
                <p>
                  Based on the information provided in the initial assessment,
                  IPENZ will determine whether the engineer's qualifications and
                  experience meet the standards expected in New Zealand. If the
                  engineer meets the standard, IPENZ will issue a letter
                  confirming that the engineer has met the requirements for
                  Skilled Migrant Category residence in New Zealand. If the
                  engineer does not meet the standard, IPENZ will provide
                  feedback on the areas where the engineer needs to improve to
                  meet the standard.
                </p>
                <h3>Full assessment</h3>
                <p>
                  If the engineer receives a positive outcome from the initial
                  assessment, they can proceed to the full assessment stage.
                  This involves providing further details of their work
                  experience, references, and other relevant documentation.
                  IPENZ will also conduct a detailed review of the engineer's
                  academic qualifications.
                </p>
                <h3>Outcome of full assessment</h3>
                <p>
                  Based on the information provided in the full assessment,
                  IPENZ will issue a final letter confirming whether the
                  engineer meets the requirements for Skilled Migrant Category
                  residence in New Zealand. If the engineer meets the
                  requirements, the letter can be submitted to the New Zealand
                  immigration authorities as part of the visa application
                  process.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  The assessment process for ICT professionals for skilled
                  migration involves several requirements and steps that an
                  applicant must fulfill. To be eligible for a New Zealand
                  skilled immigration visa, the applicant must be 55 years or
                  younger and possess skills that are crucial for the country's
                  economic growth. The visa allows the applicant to live, work,
                  and study in New Zealand indefinitely, along with their spouse
                  and children who are 24 years or younger. Currently, only
                  those who scored 160 points or more on their visa application
                  are considered eligible for this visa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For non-ICT IT professionals or engineers, the 'Work
                  Experience' section of the visa requires them to demonstrate
                  their skills through the KA02 form, which is evaluated by
                  IPENZ (now known as Engineering New Zealand). The
                  <a href="ka02-knowledge-assessment" target="_blank"
                    >IPENZ-KA02</a
                  >
                  form has five steps, including instructions and guidance,
                  showcasing one's engineering skills and knowledge, identifying
                  one's engineering discipline and field, providing evidence of
                  the knowledge profile, and supplementary evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To complete the KA02 form, the applicant needs to provide
                  evidence that they match the Washington Accord's knowledge
                  profile. This includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Showing that they have the knowledge and skills necessary to
                    solve complex engineering problems, as defined in Appendix
                    One of the form.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Provide a brief summary of key aspects of their knowledge of
                    each element of the Knowledge Profile.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The applicant needs to focus on their personal contribution,
                  writing in the first person and using 'I' or 'me' instead of
                  'we' or 'us.' They should also provide evidence of their
                  application of knowledge by including 3-4 work episodes or
                  study episodes where they applied their engineering knowledge
                  to solve complex engineering problems. The applicant should
                  include how they defined the scope of the problem, the
                  solution or design they developed for it, and the analysis
                  techniques they used. They should mention the engineering
                  models they used and how they tested those models.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the applicant has limited work experience after graduation,
                  they can mention:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The project work they did during their study period.</li>
                  <li>
                    Submit the actual calculations or analyses work they did or
                    reports they prepared during the project.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Submit certified copies of their academic transcripts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Summary of their work history, along with samples of

                </p>
                <h3>IRA for Graduates Report</h3>
                <p>
                  The Initial Professional Development (IPD) report, also known
                  as the IRA for Graduates report, is designed for recent
                  engineering graduates or engineers with limited work
                  experience. The report assesses whether the engineer has the
                  necessary competencies to progress to the next stage of their
                  professional development. It covers the engineer's academic
                  qualifications, any relevant work experience, and their
                  ability to communicate effectively in English.

                  seeking registration as Chartered Professional Engineers
                  (CPEng) in New Zealand. The report evaluates the engineer's
                  knowledge, skills, and professional attributes, and is based
                  on evidence of their work experience, academic qualifications,
                  and other relevant factors. The PCEng report is designed to
                  assess an engineer's competence to practice engineering at a
                  senior level and to demonstrate their professional standing.

                  development and to ensure that they are maintaining their
                  professional competence. This report is required for engineers
                  who have already been registered as CPEng and covers their
                  ongoing professional development activities, such as attending
                  conferences, undertaking training courses, and participating
                  in professional networks.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The IPD Readiness Assessment (IRA) report assesses whether an
                  engineer who has completed their Initial Professional
                  Development (IPD) program has achieved the required level of
                  competence to progress to the next stage of their professional
                  development. The report evaluates the engineer's work
                  experience, academic qualifications, and their ability to
                  communicate effectively in English.
