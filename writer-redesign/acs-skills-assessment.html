                  given them the responsibility of doing the skill assessment of
                  the IT/ICT professional.

                <p>
                  The Australian Computer Society analyzes the applicants with
                  serious intent and it's likely for applicants to make mistakes
                  without any guidance. However, if you feel like you need any
                  kind of help regarding ACS evaluation we may also refer to it

                  ACS Skills Assessment or simply visa assessment is a process
                  of evaluating your qualification, work experience, and duties
                  against the applied IT position and confirming the capability
                  of handling the applied job.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Australian Computer Society simply identifies whether your
                  documents meet the criteria set by the Australian government
                  regarding the applied occupation on the relevant skilled
                  occupation list (SOL).

                </p>
                <h3>Employment opportunities:</h3>
                <p>
                  A positive evaluation of your skill assessment by the
                  Australian Computer Society significantly increases your
                  chance of getting a job in the IT industry in Australia. The
                  ACS Skills Assessment makes you a legit professional for entry
                  into the country as skilled migrants. Employers from Australia
                  can trust your skills and hire you for your preferred
                  occupation.
                </p>

                <h3>Professional recognition:</h3>
                <p>
                  Skill assessment certification is considered legit
                  internationally. Being ACS certified solidifies your
                  qualifications, skills, and experience in the ICT industry. It
                  will enhance your professional reputation and career
                  prospects.
                </p>

                <h3>Skills gap analysis:</h3>
                <p>
                  The Australian Computer Society does not just accept or reject
                  applicants. They point out your skill gaps and suggest you a
                  suitable training session to close those gaps to increase your
                  chance of employment opportunities.
                </p>

                <h3>Industry insights:</h3>
                <p>
                  Skill evaluation of ACS can give you hints regarding the ICT
                  industry in Australia, job opportunities, current trends, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Overall, there really is no downside to this assessment.
                  Assessment authority helps qualified individuals to get the
                  preferred job easily in Australia and under-qualified
                  individuals get to learn about their weak spots and improve
                  them. It helps to make the employer nomination process easy
                  for us and the employers as well.

                  just to verify your identity but also to verify your skills.
                  Hence, you will need to provide various documents proving your
                  skills and qualification.
                </p>
                <h3>1. Birth certificate:</h3>
                <p>
                  Birth certificate with clear details that matches the
                  information with other documents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, Your birthdate, name, and father’s name from your
                  birth certificate should match the details on your citizenship
                  card.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Passport:</h3>
                <p>
                  The page with your details is the only one necessary for your
                  passport. There is no need to submit all the passport pages.
                </p>

                <h3>3. IDs (Two other than a Passport):</h3>
                <p>
                  Two government-issued IDs other than a passport are needed.
                  One of the IDs is essential to have a photograph. These two
                  IDS can be either from your birth country or your country of
                  current residence.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Educational Degree or Award Certification:</h3>
                <p>
                  You are required to submit your degree i.e. above senior
                  secondary or 12th standard. Australia refers to the degree as
                  tertiary education.
                </p>
                <h4>Mandatory information to include regarding your degree:</h4>

                  <b>Note:-</b> Education doesn't count if you don't have a
                  degree. You can choose to either write the last examination
                  date or the date printed on the degree, whichever is suitable
                  for you.

                    Mentioning the month without dates like JUNE 2018 to MAR
                    2019 will make the ACS assume it to be the last day of that
                    month while calculating your total work experience.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                <p>
                  Submitting a resume is not mandatory, but note that Australian
                  Computer Society guidelines do require a CV. You have the
                  option to choose not to submit your resume to the assessment

                  Let's give you detailed information about the ACS Assessment
                  for 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Australian Computer Society (ACS) is the leading
                  representative regarding IT/ICT in Australia. The Australian
                  government has given them the responsibility of doing the
                  skill assessment of the IT/ICT professional. The Australian
                  Computer Society analyzes the applicants with serious intent,
                  and applicants will likely make mistakes without any guidance.
                  However, if you need any help regarding ACS evaluation, we may
                  refer to it as visa assessment; we are here for you.

                  If you are having trouble deciding where to start preparing
                  for the ACS Skills Assessment then you can simply follow the
                  below-given steps in chronological order:
                </p>

                <h3>Step-1: Determine the correct ANZSCO code</h3>
                <p>
                  First and foremost, you should look through all the ANZSCO
                  codes and identify the one that is the best match for your
                  level of work experience and qualification.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can help you with determining your
                  <a href="/anzsco-codes">ANZSCO Code</a>
                </p>

                <h3>Step-2: Gather supporting documentation</h3>
                <p>
                  It's essential to collect all the required documents that will
                  support your qualifications and skills as evidence. These
                  documents may include academic transcripts, experience letters
                  from your current or previous employer, and English language
                  proficiency test results.
                </p>

                <h3>Step-3: Create an account on the ACS website</h3>
                <p>
                  Since the submission is done online, you are required to
                  create an account on the
                  <a
                    rel="nofollow"
                    href="https://www.acs.org.au/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >Australian Computer Society’s official website</a
                  >.
                </p>

                <h3>Step-4: Complete the online application form</h3>
                <p>
                  You are required to fill up the online application form with
                  valid information, which consists of personal details,
                  employment history, education, and qualifications.
                </p>

                <h3>Step-5: Upload supporting documents</h3>
                <p>
                  After you gather and verify all the required documents to be
                  valid, you will need to upload all the required supporting
                  documents that you collected. To be considered a "migration
                  skilled" individual, an applicant must undergo a thorough
                  assessment of their education, work experience, and English
                  language proficiency by the assessment authorities.
                </p>

                <h3>Step-6: Pay the assessment fee</h3>
                <p>
                  Since everything is done online, you are required to pay the
                  required
                  <a href="engineers-australia-assessment-fees" target="_blank"
                    >assessment fee</a
                  >
                  through the online payment system. If you do not have an
                  online method of payment then you can look for services that
                  provide an online payment system or simply ask someone you
                  know who practices an online payment system.
                </p>

                <h3>Step-7: Wait for the assessment outcome</h3>
                <p>
                  The ACS will assess your application and let you know the
                  result of your assessment through email so when you provide
                  your personal details make sure to provide the contact info
                  that you can access. The processing time can vary according to
                  the complexity and number of applied cases.
                </p>

                <h3>Step-8: Appeal the outcome if necessary</h3>
                <p>
                  Results are often disappointing but if you think that the
                  outcome of the assessment is off then you can always appeal
                  within 60 days of receiving the outcome letter.
                </p>

                  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) Form in case of NO ICT
                  Qualification
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The
                  <a href="rpl-report-writing" target="_blank"
                    >Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)</a
                  >
                  is for those who do not have an ICT-related qualification but
                  have relevant work experience in the ICT industry. Interested
                  applicants without any ICT qualification need to submit an RPL
                  form.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Since you lack the ICT qualification, this RPL form requires
                  you to showcase your skill and knowledge relevant to the ICT
                  industry through your work experience.
                </p>
                <h3>Who can apply for RPL?</h3>
                <p>
                  Any individual with legitimate experience, skills, and
                  knowledge that are relevant to the course of study can apply
                  for recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since this process is evidence-based, it doesn't matter
                  whether your work experience was in Australia or abroad. All
                  you need to do is to provide your assessor with evidence of
                  your skills and knowledge to verify your competency in the
                  relevant field.
                </p>
                <h4>How does the RPL Assessment Process work?</h4>

                <p>There are two ways you may be assessed:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    In the first case, you might be required to compile your
                    portfolio of evidence and submit, for example, a written
                    portfolio/CV/Resume only, or
                  </li>

                  The Temporary Skill Shortage Visa (TSS Visa)
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This is another one of the skilled migration visas that are
                  available for Australian migration. A TSS visa is a way for
                  the Australian authority to fund skilled workers from abroad
                  to work in positions that the Australian workers are not able
                  to work in.
                </p>

                <p>
                  TSS visa also requires ACS migration Assessment for interested
                  skilled workers who are applying under the Medium-Term stream.
                  TSS visa is only eligible for those skilled workers who have a
                  job offer in Australia for up to four years as well as whose
                  occupation is on the Medium and Long-Term Strategic Skills
                  List (MLTSSL).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Migration agents from ACS determine whether the applicant’s
                  skills and qualifications truly match the requirement of the
                  job they have been offered in Australia for a TSS visa under
                  the Medium-Term Stream.

                  The ACS Australian assessment is valid for two years, and the

                  When the validity of the ACS Skill Assessment expires before

                  assessments. The renewal process requires updating
                  experiences, but transcripts and diplomas can be reused. For
                  fast-tracking, candidates can provide their old assessment
                  reference ID.
