                <p>

                  Skill Assessment Requirement
                </h2>
                <p>
                  One of the key requirements for the 190 Visa (StateSponsored
                  Skilled Nominated Visa) is that applicants must have their
                  skills assessed by a relevant assessing authority.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For instance, as part of the visa application process,
                  engineers are typically required to undergo a skill assessment
                  by a recognized assessing authority in Australia. The
                  assessing authority will evaluate the applicant's
                  qualifications, work experience, and skills to ensure they
                  meet the required standards for their nominated occupation.
                  For engineering occupations, the assessing authority is
                  typically Engineers Australia. The purpose of the skill
                  assessment is to determine if the applicant's qualifications
                  and experience align with the Australian standards and to
                  verify their suitability for skilled migration to Australia
                  through Visa 190.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the skill assessment is successfully completed,
                  applicants can proceed with the visa application process.
                  Meeting the skill assessment requirement is a crucial step for
                  engineers to migrate to Australia on a subclass 190 visa.
