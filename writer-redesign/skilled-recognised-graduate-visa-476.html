                  Nothing can be more exciting for an individual who has an
                  engineering degree than getting a job opportunity in
                  Australia. It’s a country that focuses on a high standard of
                  living, is known for its best culture with advanced
                  technology, and offers the best wages. Moreover, the country
                  provides numerous facilities to those who migrate to Australia
                  as skilled workers. There are various schemes of visas through
                  which you can migrate to Australia one of the visas is the
                  Skilled recognized graduate subclass 476 visa. When you are
                  granted with this 476 visa you will be able to reside in
                  Australia until the validity of your visa ends.
                </p>
                <h2 id="what-is-476-visa">What is a 476 Visa?</h2>
                <p>
                  476 visa is also called a regional sponsored visa. It is a
                  temporary visa of 18 months for fresh engineering graduates
                  from recognized institutions. The skilled recognized graduate
                  visa (subclass 476) is suitable for those who are recent
                  graduates and have an engineering degree. Suppose an applicant
                  has not been able to achieve the required 60 points in the
                  points-based assessment for general skilled migration. In that
                  case, they may still be eligible for the 476 visas if they can
                  obtain sponsorship from a permanent resident in Australia or
                  if they are nominated by a state or territory government. As
                  this visa is a temporary visa and won’t lead you directly to
                  permanent residency in Australia however visa holders can use
                  this visa to gain work experience in Australia which will
                  likely enhance the possibility of obtaining permanent
                  residency through other visa pathways.

                  There are various factors that should be achieved by the visa

                  Australia is only available to individuals who meet specific
                  eligibility criteria including age, education, and previous
                  visa history. The applicant must be under 31 years of age and
                  must have a degree in one of the engineering fields such as:

                        can leave Australia for vacation for some personal

                        You cannot directly convert a Skilled Graduate visa
                        (476) into permanent residency in Australia. You can
                        explore other visa pathways for permanent residency,
                        such as skilled visas, employer sponsorship, state or
                        territory nomination, and partner visas. Each pathway
                        has its own requirements. Research and consult with a
                        migration agent for personalised advice. Please consult
