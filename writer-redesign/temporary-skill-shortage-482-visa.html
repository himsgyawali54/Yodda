                  If you are dreaming of an exciting career opportunity outside
                  your home country then look no further than the temporary
                  skill shortage visa (subclass 482 visa) in Australia. Being
                  the land of opportunities, Australia is also a dream country
                  for many individuals. The TSS 482 visa Australia after
                  replacing the 457 visa has opened the door for skilled workers
                  like you to join Australian businesses or companies which are
                  facing genuine skill shortages. You will also have a sponsor
                  ready to nominate you, and after your visa is granted then you
                  can start your journey filled with professional development
                  and cultural experiences. You should not be worried about
                  leaving your family behind too, as this visa allows you to
                  include your dependent family members in your TSS Visa
                  application. Not only this you can also find your pathway to
                  permanent residency for occupations on the medium to long-term
                  list and get a permanent residency in the coming days even if
                  this is a temporary visa.

                <h2 id="what-is-482-visa">What is 482 Visa?</h2>
                <p>
                  A 482 Visa Australia, also known as the Temporary Skill
                  Shortage (TSS) visa subclass 482, is a work visa designed
                  specifically for skilled foreign workers who have a sponsoring
                  employer ready to nominate them in Australia. In addition to
                  that, Your sponsor must provide evidence of having a genuine
                  need to fill in that position with an overseas worker. The
                  government of Australia introduced this visa as a replacement
                  for the Subclass 457 visa in March 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The TSS visa program assists Australian businesses that
                  experience genuine skill shortages and cannot find Australian
                  workers to fill vacant positions. The business that is hiring
                  foreign workers must be a Standard Business Sponsor (SBS) or
                  an Overseas Business Sponsor (OBS) to sponsor you under the
                  TSS visa. The temporary skill shortage visa subclass 482
                  program promotes Australian companies that experience genuine
                  skill shortages and cannot find Australian workers to fill
                  vacant positions. The 482 visa Australia is a visa that
                  permits the visa holder to live in Australia while working
                  full-time for the sponsoring employer who nominated you for a
                  certain occupation that is listed on the short-skilled list or
                  medium Long term Skilled list. Depending on your nominated
                  occupation, there is validity for the visa from one to four
                  years, according to the visa stream and your circumstances.

                <p>
                  The temporary skill shortage visa subclass 482 visa in
                  Australia does not have an age limit. This means anyone,
                  regardless of their age, can apply for this visa, making it a
                  significant advantage of the program. However, when applying
                  for Permanent Residency (PR) through the Temporary Residence
                  Transition stream after working for the same sponsor for three
                  years in an occupation listed on the Medium and Long-term
                  Strategic Skills List (MLTSSL), there is an age requirement.
                  Applicants need to be under 45 years old at the time of
                  lodging their Permanent Residency application unless they

                  Temporary Skill Shortage Visa Stream
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The TSS 482 Visa Australia Stream is designed to accommodate
                  different skill levels and varying periods of employment. It
                  offers three main streams:
                </p>
                <h3>Short-Term Stream</h3>
                <p>
                  The Short-term Stream of the TSS Visa is designed for
                  temporary overseas skilled workers who are required to fill
                  short-term positions in various occupations. This stream
                  allows individuals to stay in Australia for a maximum period
                  of two years, with the possibility of an extension of up to
                  four years if there is an International Trade Obligation (ITO)
                  applicable. Renewal of the visa is permitted only once, and
                  the applicant must be physically present in Australia during
                  the renewal process. The renewal is subject to the case
                  officers' assessment of the applicant's genuine temporary
                  entrant status. This stream is specifically tailored for
                  occupations listed on the Short-term Skilled Occupation List
                  (STSOL), which can be referred to for eligibility.
                </p>
                <h3>Medium-Term Stream</h3>
                <p>
                  The Medium-term stream of the TSS Visa is designed to attract
                  highly skilled overseas workers to fill medium-to-long-term
                  positions listed in the occupation list. With a maximum
                  validity of four years, this visa offers skilled individuals
                  an excellent opportunity to contribute their expertise to the
                  Australian workforce. An added advantage is that after working
                  for three years on this visa, applicants become eligible to
                  apply for TSS 482 Visa to permanent residency in Australia,
                  providing a clear pathway for those seeking long-term
                  settlement in the country. The Medium-term stream allows
                  employers to sponsor overseas skilled workers for extended
                  periods, benefiting both the Australian economy and talented
                  individuals seeking professional growth and stability in this
                  diverse and prosperous nation. The Medium- Term Stream
                  occupation is on either Medium and Long-term Strategic Skills
                  List (MLTSSL) or Regional Occupation List (ROL).
                </p>
                <h3>Labour Agreement Stream</h3>
                <p>
                  The Labour Agreement Stream of the temporary skill shortage
                  visa subclass 482 provides a specialised pathway for employers
                  who have a labour agreement with the Commonwealth of
                  Australia. This agreement enables them to hire skilled
                  overseas workers when there is a proven and specific need that
                  cannot be met through the Australian labour market or standard
                  visa programs. Through the labour agreement, employers gain
                  access to a unique avenue to bring in overseas workers to
                  address their specific workforce requirements. This stream
                  allows employers to sponsor overseas workers and facilitate
                  their employment in Australia under the terms of the
                  agreed-upon labour agreement with the Department.

                  TSS 482 Visa Subclass Process Steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The 482 TSS visa Australia is a program to facilitate the
                  employment of overseas skilled workers by Australian employers
                  to address or hire workers for temporary skill shortages. To
                  apply for this scheme of visa you must be ready to go through
                  all the processes. This process involves several steps.
                  Nevertheless, some of the important key points and major three
                  steps are listed below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The employer submits a sponsorship application.</li>
                  <li>
                    The employer files a nomination application for a skilled
                    position.
                  </li>
                  <li>The proposed employee lodges a visa application.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 1: Sponsorship by an Employer</h3>
                <p>
                  There are a number of obligations of 482 business sponsorship.
                  Also, there are many criteria that are needed to be fulfilled
                  by the TSS 482 businesses for sponsorship. The business must
                  indicate lawful and active operation in Australia. It should
                  be able to make payments to SAF(South Australia Fund).
                  Moreover, the business must be approved as a standard business
                  Sponsor (SBS) in order to employ as a TSS visa holder.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 2: Nomination Application</h3>
                <p>
                  There are 482 visa requirements for the employer to sponsor an
                  employee for this visa. As the position for skilled workers is
                  vacant, the employer must nominate the position to be filled
                  by a worker from outside of Australia. However, The nomination
                  criteria refer to the conditions and qualifications necessary
                  for the position to be approved by the Immigration Department.
                  As a part of this step of the nomination application, there
                  are various requirements to be met they are as follows:
                </p>
                <h4>Labour Market testing:</h4>
                <p>
                  When a business wants to hire a foreign worker on a TSS visa,
                  they must show that they have tried to find an Australian
                  worker for the job first. This process is called labour market
                  testing. They usually do this by showing evidence of
                  unsuccessful advertising for the position. Usually, placing
                  three ads for at least 28 days each in the last 4 months is
                  enough. However, there are cases where this might not be
                  sufficient, and they might need to provide other evidence.
                  There are exceptions to this requirement, and it's essential
                  for employers to seek professional advice to ensure they meet
                  all the rules for labour market testing. This will make the
                  visa application process smoother and more successful.
                </p>
                <h4>Salary Level:</h4>
                <p>
                  When nominating a position for a visa, the salary must meet
                  two 482 visa conditions. They are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    It should be higher than the Temporary Skilled Migration
                    Income Threshold (TSMIT), which is currently set at $53,900
                    plus superannuation. This threshold is determined yearly by
                    the Department of Home Affairs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    proposed salary must be in line with what others are getting
                    paid in the job market for similar roles. This ensures that
                    the foreign worker will receive fair compensation, just like
                    Australian employees in comparable positions.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Training Levy:</h4>
                <p>
                  The temporary skill shortage visa subclass 482 Visa Australia
                  has a new fee known as the Skilling Australians Fund (SAF)
                  levy. This fee makes it more costly for businesses to nominate
                  employees. The total amount to be paid depends on the length
                  of the visa mentioned in the nomination list. Small businesses
                  with a turnover under $10 million pay $1,200 per nominee per
                  year, while large businesses pay $1,800 per year for a TSS
                  visa. For example: If an employee applies for a four-year
                  visa, the business must pay the fee for all four years at
                  once. Here a large business nominating an employee for a
                  four-year TSS visa will need to pay $7,200 when submitting the
                  nomination.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 3: Visa Application</h3>
                <p>
                  This is the final process of visa application where the
                  nominee must show that they have met all the requirements and
                  the requisite for their occupation including health.
                  Character, and English proficiency test and all. This visa
                  costs AU$1,290 for a 2-year short-term stream, AU$2,690 for a
                  4-year medium-term stream, and AU$1,290 for your spouse's
                  visa.
                </p>
                <h4>Application Timing:</h4>
                <p>
                  This timing is considered as a process determining how long
                  the process takes from the initial phase of preparation to the
                  final decision. Generally, the application process of the
                  temporary skill shortage visa subclass 482 takes the following
                  processing times:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Short-term visa processing time: 75% within 36 days, and 90%
                    within 61 days.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Medium-term visa processing time: 75% within 33 days, 90%
                    within 49 days.

                        You can get a Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) Visa
                        Subclass 482 if you have an employer sponsor in
                        Australia. You must be nominated for a skilled position
                        by your employer, and you must meet all of the required
                        qualifications and English language proficiency. Once
                        you have been nominated, you can apply for the TSS visa,
                        undergo health checks, and also provide character
                        documents. Then finally, the Department of Home Affairs
                        will assess your application and grant the visa if
                        approved.

                        based on occupation. For the Short-Term stream, it can
                        be up to two years, and with an applicable International
                        Trade Obligation (ITO), it may extend to four years. As
                        for the Medium-Term stream, the maximum validity is four
                        years. It is important to review your visa conditions to
                        know the exact duration for your specific case.
